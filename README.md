## Processing With Azure Endpoint

### Current Azure Integration

### Azure OpenAI Benefits
- **Enterprise Security**: SOC 2 Type II compliance and enterprise-grade security
- **Data Residency**: Control over data location and processing boundaries
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Microsoft infrastructure
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for sensitive document processing

This application currently supports **OpenAI models with Azure endpoint** when the Azure option is selected. Unlike GPT-* models, **Claude is not part of Azure OpenAI Service**. When you enable the Azure endpoint:

- **Model Generation**: Can use Claude (direct Anthropic API) or OpenAI (through Azure)
- **Data Extraction**: Limited to OpenAI models only (through Azure OpenAI Service)
- **Security**: Documents are processed within Microsoft's enterprise infrastructure

### Extending Claude Support with Azure

Unlike GPT-* models, Claude is not part of Azure OpenAI Service. However, you can integrate Claude separately, for example, using Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or third-party platforms like Pipedream or n8n that bridge Azure + Anthropic APIs. ou can also configure an external model endpoint in Databricks, pointing to Claude hosted externally (e.g., Anthropic API), and treat it like an OpenAIâ€‘style model.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Generation Failures**
- Ensure API keys are correctly configured in `.env`
- Check field descriptions are clear and specific
- Verify internet connectivity for AI model access

**Extraction Errors**
- Confirm document formats are supported (PDF, DOCX, DOC)
- Check document quality and text extractability
- Review extraction context for clarity

**Azure Endpoint Issues**
- Verify Azure API key configuration
- Ensure OpenAI model selection for extraction phase
- Check network connectivity to Azure services

### Performance Optimization

**Large Document Processing**
- Use batch processing for multiple documents
- Enable progress monitoring for long-running extractions
- Consider document pre-processing for complex layouts

**Memory Management**
- Process documents in smaller batches if memory constraints occur
- Monitor system resources during large-scale extractions
